# fdi - Find Duplicate Images

An application for finding duplicate images within a directory tree.

'Duplicate' in this sense means 'very similar', not 'identical'.  It's
therefore possible for images that are of differing dimensions to be
reported as duplicates, or where the subject matter varies only very
slightly (such as a re-take of a picture where a subject blinks).

# Building the Native Dependency

The native library that interfaces with ImageMagick must be built
prior to running for the first time.  This needs pkg-config, and
the MagickWand C API.  To see if you have the required dependencies,
run 'pkg-config --cflags --libs MagickWand', which should print a list
of options and paths required.

With the MagickWand API available, all that's required is:

    cd src && make

This will install the native library into the resources folder.

Yes, I'm aware that Leiningen has its own view of where native
dependencies should go, but I haven't gotten around to making the
changes yet, and I'm really looking for something that would let
Leingingen *build* the C library, rather than just distributing it
as a binary blob.

## Usage

As an application:

    lein run /base/directory/for/images

As a library:

    (ns your-namespace
        (:require [fdi/core :as fdi]))

    (fdi/scan "/base/directory/for/images" duplicate-handler-fn)

duplicate-handler-fn will be invoked once for each set of duplicates
identified, and will be provided with a list of fingerprints, where
each fingerprint is a hash conforming to the following structure:

  { :fingerprint byte[],
	  :id          String,
		:filename    String }

# Implementation

This application is written in a mixture of Clojure (mainly), Java and
C.  It requires the ImageMagick library, in particular the MagickWand
C API, where the image 'fingerprinting' is done.

Clojure is for orchestration and concurrency, with Java for
performance-sensitive code and C for access to ImageMagick.

This application has been tested against a directory tree containing in
excess of 200,000 images.  A clean scan on a 3.4GHz Intel Core i7 2600K
running Linux takes ~1h20m.

# TODO

## Fingerprint caching

This is currently handled via SQLite, but needs re-thinking.

## Command line options

There currently aren't any, but things like --no-cache, --tolerance, etc.
could do with being configurable.
